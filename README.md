<h3>This is my first android application and repo on github</h3><br>
<h3>Author- Aadarsh Kasturey</h3><br>
<h3>used firebase realtime database. I have rules as true so anyone can read and write on it.</h3><br>
<p>This application is designed to display advertisemnets of coupons.<br>
The basic fuctions i have done are-<br> 1. It contains a logo and 6 activities. This app works only on devices with android 14 or above.<br> 2. It stores user self data on realtime database as root node and also the advertisemnets are stored. <br>3. It displayes advertisements on the home page of the app<br> 4. It searches ads based on the title.</p><br>
<h3>if you want to contribute please improve these-</h3><br><p>. i used Glide to retrieve the picture of advertisemnet but for some reason it didn't worked.<br>2. i didn't enabled the payment method option,  location tracking option, chatting activity, multi user feature, many more vulnerabilities including exception handling and security. </p>
